# Deprecated!

This was never updated since... a long time ago... So I decided to start from scratch the auto builder.

Check the new repo here! https://github.com/MrPowerGamerBR/Droidtale-v2

This is only kept for... I don't know, see how I improved at programming since the last year? Anyway, check the new repo.

## How this works?
> Alphys made this, this only works on MTT BRANDED CELLPHONES(TM)

Actually, when compiling to Windows/Android/iOS/Linux/MacOSX/etc, GameMaker: Studio creates a file called "data.win" (the name may be different depending on the plataform), this files contains graphics, code, sfx, and some other things, the "Runner" loads this file.

So... "UNDERTALE.EXE" is only a fancy runner for the "data.win" file, all of the good things are inside the "data.win" file.

Based on this topic on /r/Underminers ( https://www.reddit.com/r/Underminers/comments/3xfbfn/attention_linux_users_native_is_possible/ ), I decided to do the same thing, but with the Android runner, and, it worked!

## Known Issues
